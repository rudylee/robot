## Robot

This application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

There are no other obstructions on the table surface.

The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

## Environments

This application is developed on Mac OS X 10.10 with Ruby 1.9.3

Won't support Ruby < 1.9.3

## System Dependencies & Configuration

ruby => 1.9.3 

rspec => 3.1.5

## How to Install

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine

    ruby -v

If you don't have Ruby, I recommend [RVM](http://rvm.io/) for Mac and Linux. On Windows, you can try [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/)

Clone the project from Github

    git clone https://github.com/rudylee/robot.git

## Command File

In order to control the robot, you have to create a file containing all the commands. Here is the list of commands you can use:

### PLACE 

This will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST. 

The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.

The first valid command to the robot is a 'PLACE' command, after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another 'PLACE' command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid 'PLACE' command has been executed.

Example:

    # This command will put the robot at coordinate (2,3) and facing WEST
    PLACE 2,3,WEST

### MOVE 

This will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.


### 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT'

This will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of the robot.

### 'REPORT' 

This will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient.

I have included 3 sample command files(first_data, second_data and third_data) within this project. 

## Run the Application

Execute this command inside the directory after you clone the project

    ./bin/robot.rb <command_file>

Example
  
    # The application will read file and output the result
    ./bin/robot.rb first_data

## Testing Instructions

Make sure you have RSpec => 3.1.5 installed on your machine

    rspec -v

Run this command to run the tests

    rspec spec

## Overview

The architecture of this application is really simple. It consists of 3 main classes: Robot, Table and Command.

### Command 

Command class is responsible to parse command file and send the instructions to Robot class. 

It will also use Table class to check the validity of a position before moving or placing the robot.

### Table

Table class represents the virtual table in this application. It has a method to check the validity of x-y position. The validation method is being used by command class before performing any movement or placement for the robot. 

### Robot

This class consists of methods to perform all the commands such as rotate, move and put. 

### Improvement

There are few places I think need some improvements. The first one is the spec for command class. I believe it is better to use mock inside the spec for robot and table classes.

The next one is get_direction method inside robot class. I think there should be better way to rotate the hash.
